# MAGIC ## Exploration: `fact_order_items`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook explores the transformation logic for the `fact_order_items` silver table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The source is `ws_restaurant_dbxproject.01_bronze.orders`, which contains an `items` array column. Each element in the array represents a single ordered item. The goal is to explode that array into one row per item, cast columns to the correct types, and compute a `subtotal` per line item.

# COMMAND ----------

df=spark.read.table('ws_restaurant_dbxproject.`01_bronze`.orders')
display(df.limit(1))

# MAGIC ## Transformation — Explode items array
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using `LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(items) AS item` to flatten the nested `items` array from the bronze `orders` table into individual rows. Each resulting row represents one line item of an order.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Columns are explicitly cast to target types, and `subtotal` is derived as `unit_price * quantity`.

# MAGIC ## Verification
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Filter by a specific `order_id` to confirm that the array was correctly exploded — each row should correspond to one item in the original order, with correct types and a computed `subtotal`.

# COMMAND ----------

display(fact_menu_items.filter(fact_menu_items['order_id'] == 'ORD-20260627-428220'))
